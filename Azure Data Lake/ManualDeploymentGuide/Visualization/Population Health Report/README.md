# Population Health Report 

A population health report helps the health care providers gain insight into the population they serve and get actionable intelligence. It sheds light on the quality of care being provided and allows monitoring and bench-marking of critical metrics.Â In the Power BI-based visualization section of this solution, we have created some example reports showing the types of summarization and tracking we can do with this kind of data. Some of the reports created can be found [here](https://msit.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiM2MyMTRhZTAtOGJjYS00MDE1LThjMjItMjI5ZTY3ZTMzNjliIiwidCI6IjcyZjk4OGJmLTg2ZjEtNDFhZi05MWFiLTJkN2NkMDExZGI0NyIsImMiOjV9).
