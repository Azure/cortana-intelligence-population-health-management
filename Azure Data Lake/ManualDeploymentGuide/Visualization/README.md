# Visualizing the Population Health Report with Power BI

After deploying the [Population Health Management Solution](../../ManualDeploymentGuide/), simulated patient data and predictions will begin to accumulate. This README describes the steps necessary to display and glean insights from the data using Power BI. The instructions below outline how to connect your Power BI to the data in your Data Lake Store and display real-time data streaming through your Azure Stream Analytics in Power BI dashboards. We have provided a power BI file with an example Population Health report and will guide you though creating some visuals and publishing a dashboard.

# Data
For this solution, we have used simulated patient hospital visit records based on State Inpatient Data ([SID](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/sidoverview.jsp)) from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project ([HCUP](http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/)). The records we produce match the HCUP [schema](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/state/siddist/siddistvarnote2013.jsp) to facilitate the solution's use with [real HCUP data](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tech_assist/centdist.jsp). The solution simulates 610 clinical and demographic features, including age, gender, zipcode, diagnoses, procedures, charges, etc. for about a million patients across 23 hospitals. We also provide another data file called 'ReadmittanceTarget' which contains metrics to be followed by a hospital to track Readmission Rate. 

### ***About HCUP and SID***

The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) is a group of healthcare databases that contain the the largest collection of longitudinal hospital care data in the United States. It is a national information resource for encounter-level health care data that captures information extracted from administrative data (patients' billing records) after a patient is discharged from the hospital. HCUP's State Inpatient Databases (SID) contain inpatient care records from community hospitals in each state. With forty-eight states participating, SID now encompass about 97 percent of all U.S. community hospital discharges. The SID files contain a core set of clinical and demographic information on all patients, providing a unique view of inpatient care over time. 

# [Population Health Report](https://msit.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNWJjM2U0OTItNDIzZi00MTA2LWJkMzktY2ZlYjlkMzM0OTEzIiwidCI6IjcyZjk4OGJmLTg2ZjEtNDFhZi05MWFiLTJkN2NkMDExZGI0NyIsImMiOjV9)

A population health report helps the health care providers gain insight into the population they serve and get actionable intelligence. It sheds light on the quality of care being provided and allows monitoring and bench-marking of critical metrics.Â For this solution, we have created some example reports showing the types of summarization and tracking we can do with this kind of data. Some of the reports created can be found [here](https://msit.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNWJjM2U0OTItNDIzZi00MTA2LWJkMzktY2ZlYjlkMzM0OTEzIiwidCI6IjcyZjk4OGJmLTg2ZjEtNDFhZi05MWFiLTJkN2NkMDExZGI0NyIsImMiOjV9).

# Visualize Data from Data Lake Store

> Note: Before beginning this section, you must download and install the (free) [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop) program. 

Once data is flowing into you Data Lake Store, [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop) can be used to build visualizations. Power BI can directly connect to an Azure Data Lake Store as its data source, where the historical data as well as the prediction results are stored.  The goal is to visualize the historic data and length of stay predictions in near-real time as new patients get admitted to the hospital. The [provided PBI Dashboard file](../../ManualDeploymentGuide/Visualization/PopulationHealthManagement.pbix) needs to connect to two data files in Data Lake store: `data4visualization_latest.csv` and `ReadmittanceTarget.csv`. During deployment, `ReadmittanceTarget.csv` was copied into the `/forphmdeploymentbyadf` subdirectory of your Azure Data Lake Store. `data4visualization_latest.csv` is in subdirectiry `pbidataforPHM`of your Azure Data Lake Store. In the steps below, we will change the source of the Power BI file from local files to the csv files in Data Lake Store.

#### 1) Get the connection credentials

To connect to the data in your Azure Data Lake Store, you will need to supply Power BI Desktop with your **ADL URI**, which you can obtain as follows:

- Log into [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
- Use the search bar at the top of the screen to search for your resource group by name.
- After clicking on your resource group in the search results, find your Data Lake Store in the resource group pane and click on it.
- In the Data Lake Store's overview pane, copy the **ADL URI**. It will look similar to [this](../../ManualDeploymentGuide/media/adlsuri1.PNG?raw=true):
    `adl://************.adlsdefault.azuredatalakestore.net/`. 

  
#### 2)	Update the data source of the Power BI file by modifying the query connection strings

- Download the example dashboard file 'PopulationHealthManagement.pbix' from [here](../../ManualDeploymentGuide/Visualization) and Open it.
    - **Note:** If you see an error message, please make sure you have installed the latest version of [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop). 
- You will see a message "There are pending changes in your queries that haven't been applied". Ignore this message. 
- Click on `Edit Queries` in the ribbon at the top of your screen. You will see two data sources under Queries panel at the left.
- Select `data4PBI_simulated` in the query list at left, and click on `Advanced Editor` in the ribbon at the top of the screen.
- You will see a query in the editor that will look like [this](https://github.com/Azure/cortana-intelligence-population-health-management/raw/master/Azure%20Data%20Lake/ManualDeploymentGuide/media/connectionquery1.txt). Replace the ADL uri "adl://phmciqs1w6adls.azuredatalakestore.net" with your ADL uri that you copied in step above and click on `Done` and close it.
- Next, select `ReadmittanceTarget` in the query list and click on "Advanced Editor".
- You will see a query in the editor that will look like [this](https://github.com/Azure/cortana-intelligence-population-health-management/raw/master/Azure%20Data%20Lake/ManualDeploymentGuide/media/connectionquery2.txt). Replace the ADL uri "adl://phmciqs1w6adls.azuredatalakestore.net" with your ADL uri that you copied in step above and click on `Done` and close it.
- In the Query Editor click "Close & Apply" in the ribbon at the top of your screen.
    - The data sources will update and point to the files in your Data Lake Store.
- In the backend, model is scheduled to be refreshed every 1 hour. You can click **'Refresh'** button on the top to get the latest visualization as time moves forward.

#### 3) Publish the dashboard to [Power BI Online](http://www.powerbi.com/)
  Note that to complete this step, you will need a (free) Power BI or Office 365 account.

- Click **"Publish"** on the ribbon along the top of your screen, You will be prompted to sign into your Power BI account.
- Sign in with your work or school account.
- When prompted to select a destination, choose **'My Workspace'**.
- After about a minute, you will see a  "Success!" message containing a link to open your published report in Power BI.
    - If you have any trouble, you can learn more about how to publish dashboard to Power BI [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-desktop-upload-desktop-files/).
- Click the link in the "Success!" message to view your Power BI desktop file in a browser. If prompted, enter your Power BI online credentials.

Once you successfully log in, you will be able to see all the reports from your Power BI desktop file in the browser. Next, we will pin individual visualizations from some of our reports into a dashboard:
- Select a visualization from a report that you want in your dashboard and click on the thumbtack symbol at the upper-right of the visual (which will say 'Pin Visual' when your mouse hovers over the icon).
- You will be prompted to select an existing dashboard or create a new one. Let's create a new dashboard.
- Enter a name for your dashboard, e.g. "PHM demo".
- When you press Enter, you will see a notification that your visualization has been pinned to your dashboard and a "Go to dashboard" link is provided at upper-right. Click on the link to go to your dashboard.
