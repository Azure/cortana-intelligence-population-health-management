# Population Health Management for Healthcare - A Cortana Intelligence Solution

### ***The state of Healthcare***
According to the [Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nationalhealthaccountshistorical.html), U.S. health care spending reached $3.2 trillion -- or $9,990 per person -- in 2015, accounting for 17.8 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. One-third of this health care expenditure comes from hospital inpatient care. With spending [projected](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/medicare-provider-charge-data/downloads/publiccomments.pdf) to reach $4.8 trillion in 2021, health care has become the [top concern](http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/tabsHPTrumpIssues20170320.pdf) for Americans, even surpassing the economy. Concerted efforts are being made to reduce spending. The recent shift in government [payment models](https://www.healthcatalyst.com/hospital-transitioning-fee-for-service-value-based-reimbursements) from fee-for-service to pay-for-value is aimed specifically at reducing the governmentâ€™s spending on health care and curtailing the growing budget deficits. Under this model, disease prevention and management is rewarded while poor outcomes are penalized. This shift from fee-for-service payments to value-based care is transforming the US health care industry and forcing providers to provide better care at a lower cost, impacting their bottom line.
