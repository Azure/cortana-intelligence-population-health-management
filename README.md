# Population Health Management for Healthcare - A Cortana Intelligence Solution

## The state of Health Care
According to the [Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nationalhealthaccountshistorical.html), U.S. health care spending reached $3.2 trillion -- or $9,990 per person -- in 2015, accounting for 17.8 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. One-third of this health care expenditure comes from hospital inpatient care. With spending [projected](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/medicare-provider-charge-data/downloads/publiccomments.pdf) to reach $4.8 trillion in 2021, health care has become the [top concern](http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/tabsHPTrumpIssues20170320.pdf) for Americans, even surpassing the economy. Concerted efforts are being made to reduce spending. The recent shift in government [payment models](https://www.healthcatalyst.com/hospital-transitioning-fee-for-service-value-based-reimbursements) from fee-for-service to pay-for-value is aimed specifically at reducing the governmentâ€™s spending on health care and curtailing the growing budget deficits. Under this model, disease prevention and management is rewarded while poor outcomes are penalized. This shift from fee-for-service payments to value-based care is transforming the US health care industry and forcing providers to provide better care at a lower cost, impacting their bottom line. 

## What is Population Health Management

Population Health Management is an important tool that is increasingly being used by health care providers to manage and control the escalating costs. The crux of Population Health Management is to use data to improve health outcomes. Tracking, monitoring and bench marking are the three bastions of Population Health Management, aimed at improving clinical and health outcomes while managing and reducing cost. 

## Ingredients for a successful Population Health Management solution
 
A successful population health management initiative requires establishing a repository that can collect data from multiple sources in any and all formats, whether it be structured, semi-structured or unstructured. Furthermore, the repository needs to be able to integrate the disparate data sources, with a fast time-to-action to flexibly meet ever-evolving healthcare analytics needs. By analyzing the patient population to gain insight into its socioeconomic constitution, demographics, and overall medical condition across geospatial regions, health care providers can better understand the quality of care being provided and identify areas for improvement and cost savings. 

The Azure Data Lake Store & Analytics is one such technology that has all the capabilities required to build a population health management repository. The [Azure Data Lake Store (ADLS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-overview) allows users to store data of any size, shape and speed, while [Azure Data Lake Analytics (ADLA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-analytics/data-lake-analytics-overview) has the capability to conduct data processing, advanced analytics, and machine learning modeling with high scalability in a cost-effective way. Using U-SQL, R, Python and/or .NET, it allows users to run massively parallel data transformation and processing over petabytes of data. As an alternative choice of advanced analytics engine, [Spark on HDInsight](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-apache-spark-overview) is also a top selection. Besides the native language support to scala and Java to do data analytics such as MLLib, it also has interface to support R server and Pytohn (PySpark). There are several decsion points when choosing between ADLA or Spark as the analytics tool. First of all, ADLA is based on Azure platform, while Spark is open source and can be migrated to other cloud platforms conveniently. Second, U-SQL skills are required when using ADLA. Last but not least, ADLA only costs money while the query job is executing, but HDInsight spark cluster always incurs a cost as long as the cluster is launched. 

## What's in this solution

In this solution guide, we present two use cases under the umbrella of Population Health Management: [Hospital Length of Stay (LOS) prediction](./Azure%20%Data%20%Lake/README.MD), and [Patient-Specific Readmission Prediction and Intervention for Health Care](./Spark/README.MD) for both resource planning and day-to-day decision making. With different input data schema, the former use case showcase the usage of ADLA with U-SQL and R, while the latter use case makes usage of HDInsight Spark 2.0 with PySpark as the analytics engine.
