# Population Health Management for Healthcare - A Cortana Intelligence Solution

### ***The state of Healthcare***
According to the [Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nationalhealthaccountshistorical.html), U.S. health care spending reached $3.2 trillion -- or $9,990 per person -- in 2015, accounting for 17.8 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. One-third of this health care expenditure comes from hospital inpatient care. With spending [projected](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/medicare-provider-charge-data/downloads/publiccomments.pdf) to reach $4.8 trillion in 2021, health care has become the [top concern](http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/tabsHPTrumpIssues20170320.pdf) for Americans, even surpassing the economy. Concerted efforts are being made to reduce spending. The recent shift in government [payment models](https://www.healthcatalyst.com/hospital-transitioning-fee-for-service-value-based-reimbursements) from fee-for-service to pay-for-value is aimed specifically at reducing the governmentâ€™s spending on health care and curtailing the growing budget deficits. Under this model, disease prevention and management is rewarded while poor outcomes are penalized. This shift from fee-for-service payments to value-based care is transforming the US health care industry and forcing providers to provide better care at a lower cost, impacting their bottom line. 

### ***What is Population Health Management*** 

Population Health Management is an important tool that is increasingly being used by health care providers to manage and control the escalating costs. The crux of Population Health Management is to use data to improve health outcomes. Tracking, monitoring and bench marking are the three bastions of Population Health Management, aimed at improving clinical and health outcomes while managing and reducing cost. 

### ***Ingredients for a successful Population Health Management solution***
 
A successful population health management initiative requires establishing a repository that can collect data from multiple sources in any and all formats, whether it be structured, semi-structured or unstructured. Furthermore, the repository needs to be able to integrate the disparate data sources, with a fast time-to-action to flexibly meet ever-evolving healthcare analytics needs. By analyzing the patient population to gain insight into its socioeconomic constitution, demographics, and overall medical condition across geospatial regions, health care providers can better understand the quality of care being provided and identify areas for improvement and cost savings. The Microsoft Azure Data Lake is one such technology that has all the capabilities required to build a population health management repository. It not only permits users to store data of any size, shape and speed, it also has the capability to conduct data processing, advanced analytics, and machine learning modeling with high scalability in a cost-effective way. Using U-SQL, R, Python and/or .NET, it allows users to run massively parallel data transformation and processing over petabytes of data. It is truly a one-stop-shop for population health reporting, advanced analytics and predictive modeling. 

### ***What's in this solution***

In this Population Health Management solution guide, we will be leveraging clinical and socioeconomic in-patient data (simulated) generated by the hospitals for population health reporting. Additionally, we will also be making predictions for the length of hospital stay. Hospitals can use these results to optimize care management systems and focus their clinical resources on patients with more urgent need. Understanding the communities they serve through population health reporting can help hospitals transition from fee-for-service payments to value-based care while reducing costs and providing better care. In the deployment guide folders above, you will find instructions on how to create a Population Health Management solution using different components of the Cortana Intelligence Suite.

# Getting Started #

This solution package contains materials to help both technical and business audiences understand our Population Health Management solution for health care built on the [Cortana Intelligence Suite](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/cortana-intelligence-suite/Overview.aspx).

## Business Audiences

In this repository you will find a folder labeled [*Solution Overview for Business Audiences*](../ManualDeploymentGuide/SolutionOverviewforBusinessAudiences) which contains a presentation covering this solution and the benefits of using the Cortana Intelligence Suite.

For more information on how to tailor Cortana Intelligence to your needs, [connect with one of our partners](http://aka.ms/CISFindPartner).

## Technical Audiences

For technical audiences, we have put together a manual deployment guide as well as an automated deployment guide. The manual deployment guide is geared towards the more technically bent who want to understand how to spin up the different components and how they can be connected together to build an end-to-end pipeline. The automated deployment guide is for seeing the entire solution in action without having to do all the wiring manually.

### [Manual Deployment Guide](../ManualDeploymentGuide)
In this folder, you will find instructions on how to put together and deploy from the ground up a population Health Management solution using the Cortana Intelligence Suite.  It will walk you through how to manually set up and deploy all the individual services used in this solution (e.g. Azure Event Hub, Data Lake Store, Azure Stream Analytics etc.). 

### [Automated Deployment Guide](../ManualDeploymentGuide)
There is also a deployable Population Health Management solution in the Cortana Intelligence Gallery (offering one-click deployment of all services required for this solution!). In this folder, you will find instructions on how to monitor the progress of your automated deployment (takes about 20 minutes to deploy) and carry out some post-deployment steps.
